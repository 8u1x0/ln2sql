# ln2sql

<b>ln2sql is a tool to query a database in natural language</b>, as described in the following French paper (which can be found in the <i>docs/</i> directory):

<i><a rel="license" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278965118_fr2sql_Interrogation_de_bases_de_donnees_en_francais">Benoît Couderc and Jérémy Ferrero. fr2sql : Database Query in French. (fr2sql : Interrogation de bases de données en français [in French]). In Proceedings of the 17th RECITAL (affiliated with the 22th TALN Conference). June 2015. Caen, France. ATALA. pp.1-12 </a></i>

In view to learn Python, I recently decided to implement our originally PHP project in <b>Python</b>. In addition, that will allow me to share the tool with the English-speaking community by making it public available here.

### Supported languages

The tool can deal with any language, so long as it has its configuration file (<i>i.e.</i> a file with the keywords of the language).

Language configuration files can be found in <i>lang/</i> directory. The files are CSV files. Each line represent a type of keywords. Anything before the colon is ignored. Keywords must be separated by a comma. 

You can build your own language configuration file following the English and French templates.

### Database input

To be effective ln2sql need to learn the data model of the database that the user want to query. It need to load the corresponding SQL dump file to do that.<br/>
A <a rel="dump" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_dump">database dump</a> is a file containing a record of the table structure and/or the data of a database.

##### Usage of the Database class

```python
database = Database()
database.load("database/tal.sql")
database.print_me()
```
For the following SQL statements loaded, the output in the terminal looks like:

### Thesaurus and Stop word list

You can improve the keyword filtering using a thesaurus.<br/>
Thesaurus can be found in <i>thesaurus/</i> directory.<br/>
You can build your own thesaurus following the <a rel="thesaurus" href="http://extensions.openoffice.org/en/search?f%5B0%5D=field_project_tags%3A157">OpenOffice template</a>.

You can improve the stop word filtering using a stop word list.<br/>
You can build your own stop word list following the template of the lists in <i>stopwords/</i> directory.

### Usage

You can directly use the python wrapper by the following way:
```
Usage: 
	python ln2sql.py -d <path> -l <path> -i <input-sentence> [-t <path>] [-j <path>]
Parameters:
	-h						print this help message
	-d <path>				path to sql dump file
	-l <path>				path to language configuration file
	-i <input-sentence>		input sentence to parse
	-j <path>				path to JSON output file
	-t <path>				path to thesaurus file
```
example of usage:
```
python ln2sql.py -i "What is the number of students?" -l lang/english.csv -d database/tal.sql -j output.json
```
or by graphical interface by typing the following command:
```
python ln2sql_gui.py
```
a window like the one below will appear:

### JSON output

With the following input:
```
What is the average age of students whose name is Doe or age over 25?
```
the output is:
```JSON
{
	"select": {
		"column": "age",
		"type": "AVG"
	},
	"from": {
		"table": "student"
	},
	"join": {
	
	},
	"where": {
		"conditions": [
			{ "column": "name",
			  "operator": "==",
			  "value": "Doe"
			},
			{ "operator": "or" },
			{ "column": "age",
			  "operator": ">=",
			  "value": "25"
			}
		]
	},
	"group_by": {
	
	},
	"order_by": {
	
	}
}
```
### Conception

</p>
The tool is implemented under the Model-View-Controller pattern. The classes imported from the Python Standard Library do not appear in the diagram except those required for inheritance (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Thread</i> or <i>Exception</i>).
